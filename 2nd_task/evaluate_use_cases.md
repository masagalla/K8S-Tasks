### Evaluate the Use cases :

---

### ✅ **When to Use Kubernetes** (Top 5 Scenarios)

1. **Large-Scale Microservices Architecture**

   * You have many services that need independent deployment, scaling, and management.
   * 📌 *Example*: A food delivery app with services like orders, payments, tracking, etc.

2. **CI/CD Workflows and Automation**

   * You want automated testing, deployment, and rollback of containerized apps.
   * 📌 *Example*: A fintech app releasing updates multiple times per day.

3. **Auto-Scaling Applications**

   * You need your system to scale up/down based on traffic or resource usage.
   * 📌 *Example*: An e-commerce platform scaling during festival sales.

4. **Multi-Cloud or Hybrid Deployments**

   * You want flexibility to run workloads across AWS, Azure, GCP, or on-prem.
   * 📌 *Example*: A SaaS provider supporting clients across different cloud regions.

5. **Canary or Blue-Green Deployments**

   * You require zero-downtime releases and safe version rollouts.
   * 📌 *Example*: Rolling out new features to 10% of users before full release.

### ❌ **When *Not* to Use Kubernetes** (Top 5 Scenarios)

1. **Simple Single-Container Applications**

   * Overkill for apps that can run with plain Docker or basic PaaS (like Heroku).
   * 📌 *Example*: A personal blog or portfolio site.

2. **Serverless-First Workloads**

   * Event-driven or short-lived tasks better suited to serverless (e.g., AWS Lambda).
   * 📌 *Example*: A function triggered by file upload to process an image.

3. **Very Small Teams with No DevOps Expertise**

   * High learning curve, requires dedicated maintenance and observability.
   * 📌 *Example*: A two-person startup with no infrastructure engineer.

4. **Applications Without Scaling or High Availability Needs**

   * Static or rarely accessed apps don't need orchestration complexity.
   * 📌 *Example*: An internal HR dashboard used by 5 employees.

5. **Rapid Prototypes or MVPs**

   * Slows down fast iterations; better to use simple Docker or serverless to validate ideas.
   * 📌 *Example*: A weekend hackathon project.
